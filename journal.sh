# "journal-file" in the userâ€™s home directory, if such a file exists. If existent, will 
# allow user input for a journal entry.


# adds a journal entry named "journal-file" to home directory 
file=$HOME/journal-file	

# tests for file existence
if [ ! -e $file ]
then
        echo "File does not exist in current path."
        exit 1
fi

# executes if user has permission to write to file
